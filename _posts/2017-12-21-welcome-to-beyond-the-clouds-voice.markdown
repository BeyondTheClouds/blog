We are proud to introduce you to Didier Iscovery blog, the voice of the people
from the [Discovery project][btc-site] embodied in this elegant blog. It will be chiefly
talking about Massively Distributed Clouds, Fog and Edge Computing and all
other topics around (with a particular focus on OpenStack).
We are a small team, but remind, size does not really matter and our door is open to new contributors.
